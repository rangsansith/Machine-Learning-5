# Machine-Learning
The repository contains my code of machine learning algorithms coded in java and python . 
These include 
1) Hidden Markov Models 
2) Principal componenet analysis . 
3) K-Means clustering 
4) EM-Clustering . 
5)EM-clustering with gaussian distribution 
6)Scoring files  using forward algorithm. 
7) Multiple sequence allignment for Profile Hidden Markov models 
8)Singular value decomposition 
9) quadratic programming : SSMO - Group
